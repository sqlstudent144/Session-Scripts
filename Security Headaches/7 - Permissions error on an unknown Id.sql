the Tin🌲👨 is a service account and the users aren't really sure if that's
actually the account being used. All they have is the error:

Msg 229, Level 14, State 5, Line 5
The SELECT permission was denied on the object '🌲🌲🌲Paths', database '😺&🐯&🐻o🙋', schema 'dbo'.

And that error, while it tells us exactly what permission is missing and on what
object, it doesn't tell us who exactly is missing the permission.
